    <h4>Why a prototype?</h4>
    <p>
        An live prototype will demonstrate more clearly how sites should work and how content can adapt to different layouts. We can show responsiveness as well as show interactivity.

    <h4>What is this built with?</h4>
    <p>
        Are you really asking? <3
    </p>

    <h4>Karma</h4>
    <p>This is a prototype, so no. No Karma.</p>
